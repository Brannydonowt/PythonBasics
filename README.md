# PythonBasics
Updated 04/11/2021

I'm trying to learn Python!

This repository will contain any small-scale projects I work on in order to teach myself Python.

I'll be using a wide variety of resources, as well as my own coding knowledge in order to learn what I need.

My goal is to begin developing hard to detect bots for different games!
